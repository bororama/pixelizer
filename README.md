# pixelizer
Simple 'pixel-art' from the command line.

The output image is in fact generated by an ordered dithering algorithm. 
User-defined color palettes can be handled, there are several sample-palettes inside the palettes folder. 

# initialization
If you have Docker, 
first spin up the container like so:
```console
artist:~$ sh start_environment.sh
```
Then compile the executable (this step may be done just once)
```console
artist:~$ make
```
And you're done.

Should you not want to use docker, check the Dockerfile for all necessary dependencies.
